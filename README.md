# Password Generator

The purpose of this homework assignment was to write the JavaScript code to enable the usage of a password generator (HTML and CSS files were already included).

## Criteria

* We want to prompt the user to select an integer between 8 and 128 for the password length
* We want to validate their prompt to ensure invalid responses are not allowed
* We want to prompt the user to select what types of characters to allow in the password
  * To allow or not allow lowercase letters
  * To allow or not allow uppercase letters
  * To allow or not allow numbers
  * To allow or not allow special characters
* We want to validate and ensure the user selected at least one type of character set
* Once all prompts have been completed successfully, the password is generated according to criteria and printed on screen 

## Notes
A list of special characters was provided here, [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation. All special characters were used except for the Space character.

Since the HTML and CSS files were already provided, the JS file was the only thing that needed to be worked on. Majority of JavaScript code used were items we learned in the class up until the present time of doing the homework assignment.
